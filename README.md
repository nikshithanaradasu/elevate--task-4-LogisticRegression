# Task 4: Logistic Regression - Binary Classification

## Objective
Build a binary classifier using logistic regression on a breast cancer dataset.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
- Dataset: `data.csv`
- Target Variable: `diagnosis`  
  - Malignant: 1  
  - Benign: 0

## Workflow
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset
2. Converted target variable to numeric
3. Performed train-test split
4. Standardized features
5. Trained logistic regression model
6. Evaluated using:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
   - ROC-AUC Curve
7. Visualized top influential features

## Result
Achieved good performance on test data. Logistic Regression proved effective for binary classification in this case.
